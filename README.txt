I guess I should've put this in the game itself shouldn't have I... nah it gets people to read this lol
I'm not gonna tell you how to do everything, use common sense.

Food Swap: Use the arrow keys (left, right) to swap between food items.

Natural Regen: Every ten seconds you will regain half a heart back.

Swap Enemies: Click on the enemy sprite on board to swap your attack over to it.

Show Enemy Attack: press "a" on your keyboard

Show food amount: press "f" on your keyboard

Dodge Projectile: Hover your mouse over the circle when it appears. Doing so will dodge ranged attacks. 

	Keyboard Dodge: Press shift to dodge any incoming projectiles although pressing space when non are active will take player damage

Totem of undying: The totem will be used when you are killed. They drop from Evokers. You only respawn with one heart, don't spam

Pro Tip T&E: Use tab and enter to play
